## Project Description

PGconnect is a web application designed to simplify the process of finding paying guest (PG) accommodations for interns in Bangalore. 
Inspired by the challenges faced during internship PG hunting, PGconnect aims to provide a user-friendly platform where interns can 
discover, review, and select suitable PGs based on their preferences and requirements.

## Features

1. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
    Secure sign-up and login functionality for users.
    Authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access and protection of user data.
   
3. **Listing Management:**
    CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for PG listings.
    Dedicated routes for listing management including new listing creation, editing, updating, and deletion.
   
5. **Review System:**
    Capability for users to leave reviews and ratings for PG accommodations.
    Integration of user reviews into PG listings to aid decision-making for other users.
   
7. **Responsive UI/UX:**
    User-friendly interface with a responsive design for seamless experience across devices.
    Consistent navigation with a navbar and footer for easy access to different sections of the application.
   
9. **Validation and Error Handling:**
    Client-side validation to ensure data integrity and prevent erroneous inputs.
    Custom error handling to provide meaningful feedback to users in case of errors.
   
11. **Database and Backend:**
    MongoDB as the database to store PG listings, user information, and reviews.
    Node.js and Express.js for the backend server to handle HTTP requests and responses.
    Integration of Mongoose middleware for schema validation and data modeling.

12. **Maps API**
    Integrating interactive maps into the web application using Mapbox API and Mapbox GL JS, a JS library.
    This allows users to view and interact with custom maps, complete with markers, popups, and real-time data.
